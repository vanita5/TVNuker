#TV Nuker#

TV Nuker is more of an experimental project where I have fun with the IR transmitter of my HTC One.

####Current Goals:####
* TV Killer (like [this](www.getdigital.de/TV-B-Gone.html) kind of thing with your Smartphone)
* LED RGB Remote (there already is an app for this in the PlayStore, however, it does not allow custom 
mapping)
* X Killer (other devices like Projectors, DVD-Players,...)?

####Supported Devices:####
Every device with an build in IR transmitter should work, as I use the new android IR API, available 
since Android 4.4 (KitKat).
This also means, that you must have a 4.4+ ROM on your device.
